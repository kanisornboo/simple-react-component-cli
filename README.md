# React CLI (Component)

## Description

This project is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for creating a new React component with a specific structure. It uses the [commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) package to handle command-line arguments and the [fs-extra](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra) package to interact with the file system.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To use the CLI, run the following command:

```bash
./cli.js YourComponentName

```

## Notes

The line #!/usr/bin/env node at the top of your JavaScript file is called a shebang. This line tells the system that this script should be executed using Node.js.
